Silent Night: The Night the Reindeer Died
================

This was a game I made for [Dublin Gamecraft 4](http://dublingamecraft.com/2013/12/09/dublin-gamecraft-4/). The theme was "Always winter but never Christmas", so I made a game where you play as Santa Claus on the worst snowstorm the North Pole has ever seen, so you have to find your various reindeer by moving towards the sound of their bells. It's still very buggy, but not bad for 11 hours of work.
