# Plane Game

This was my second-ever gamejam game. I can't remember the theme, but the idea was that there would be a baby being carried away by helium balloons and the only way you could save it was by shooting a load of food at the baby, making it fat and heavy and have it fall to the ground that way. I got as far as implementing the plane movement and the firing.
